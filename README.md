Data Science Job Finder Web App


This repository contains the code for a web application that assists users in finding the most suitable data science jobs according to their qualifications. The application is built using Streamlit, an open-source Python library that simplifies the process of creating custom web applications for machine learning and data science.

Features
The web application includes four main sections:

Introduction: The home page of the app provides an overview of the app and guides users on how to navigate and use the different features.

Filter Jobs: Users can filter the available data science jobs based on several parameters such as the company, job title, location, job type, experience level, and salary range.

Match Credentials: This feature allows users to input their qualifications, such as their degree, certifications, and years of experience. The application then matches these with job requirements to find the best fitting jobs.

General Statistics: This section provides insightful visualizations about available jobs, like the distribution of jobs by company, average salary for different job titles, salary expectations based on skills, etc.

The app uses a dataset of data science jobs (fictitious or real depending on your source), which is loaded, cleaned, and processed using pandas. Interactive visuals are created using Plotly.

The end goal of this application is to provide a user-friendly platform where job seekers can filter job opportunities based on their preferences and credentials and gain insights about the current job market in the data science field.
